# levels_of_aiml_autonomy_and_automation

There are a few variations on how the levels are defined, with some notable differences between US federal regulator descriptions and popular articles.

### NHTSA | National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2022)
- Term: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) 
- https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-05/Level-of-Automation-052522-tag.pdf



# Version 1: Federal Regulator Version

# Version 2: Popular Version
0. Momentary assistance  to human action / human operator.
- alerts, warnings, specific event response
- e.g. check-engine light
- proximity beep
- (analogy: highlight possibly-misspelled word)

1. Single-Task Continuous assistance: 
- marginal breaking help alone (single type of help)
- marginal acceleration help alone (single type of help)
- marginal steering help alone (single type of help)
(analogy: spelling suggestings, continuous auto-save)

2. Multi-Task Continuous Assistance to human action / human operator.
- marginal breaking help (in addition to other assistance types)
- marginal acceleration help  (in addition to other assistance types)
- marginal steering help  (in addition to other assistance types)
(analogy: spelling suggestings, continuous auto-save)

3. Optional Complete Continuous Control of All Systems, with human present for oversight and hand-over (human taking control)
- during windows of optimal and least-risk contexts, AI can take more or all actions alone, but overall there is a human driving.

4. Full Complete Continuous Control of All Systems in an enclosed 'geofenced' location/context (no human required to be present)
- 'context' limitations can be: space location, weather conditions, specific time-windows, etc.
- autonomous cart within factory, often full of sensors to support and contain cart
- parking lot device outside of business hours (e.g. 2-am to 4-am) 

5. Full Complete Continuous Control of All Systems open public (no human required to be present)
- all contexts (time, place, conditions, etc.)
- access to all roads
- access at all times
- access under all conditions

Note this government regulation wording is significantly different from, and more detailed and nuanced than, popular internet posts:

0. No assistance or autonomy
1. simple assistance (no autonomy)
2. advanced assistance (no autonomy)
3. very limited autonomy in specific contexts
4. moderate autonomy in more contexts
5. full autonomy (all contexts)
